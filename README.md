# Neural Synchronisation Collaborative Learning System
The Neural Synchronisation Collaborative Learning System is a platform designed to moderate group discussions by encouraging balanced participation, providing mental health support, and ensuring readability for individuals with essential tremors. It integrates real-time feedback mechanisms, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition to create an inclusive and supportive environment for all participants.

## FEATURES
The platform facilitates group discussions by:
- Encouraging quiet individuals to share ideas.
- Regulating participation to ensure everyone has an opportunity to speak.
- Providing prompts to initiate discussions and rotate topics based on group dynamics.
- Offering text-to-speech functionality for participants with visual impairments.
  
## ARCHITECTURE
The project is developed using various technologies and algorithms:

- Speech Recognition: Implemented with Azure Speech Service for real-time transcription of spoken content.
- Sentiment Analysis: Integrated Azure Text Analytics to analyze written content and adapt AI responses based on detected sentiment.
- Neural Synchronisation Algorithms: Developed algorithms to identify speech dominance, encourage balanced participation, and adapt responses in real-time.
- Accessibility Features: Included text-to-speech functionality and readability enhancements for individuals with essential tremors.
  

## FUTURE SCOPE
Gesture Recognition Integration: Combining speech recognition with gesture recognition to provide additional engagement options.
Language Support: Extending language support and natural language processing capabilities to cater to a wider audience.
